Here you will find the recap of some of  the work done during my studies at CFA Insta.
These files contains mostly linux environnement files, AND they are not intended to be use in PRODUCTION.

This will setup a small infrastructure (not secured for production), and automatize most of the processes.

If you are a student from Insta, please learn the concepts by yourself and use this repository as a helper.
Do not hesitate to make any branch to make it better !

The repository is organized like this : 

<!> everything is setup on rocky linux 9.3 <!>

00-linux-cli => Simple linux command lines made in 3rd year when I was discovering linux shell

01-DNS => Simple DNS setup with bind9, I will add a second part with ddns (dynamic zone, a mix of dhcp and DNS services)

02-Ansible => First Automation with Ansible, to add hosts, push shell commands, push scripts and excute them, and automate Kubernetes installation and app deployments, Prometheus/NodeExportes/Grafana stack and deployment, and DNS automation

03-Docker => Docker commands and application setups

04-Kubernetes => Kubernetes explanation, services, secrets, persistent storage with simple applications, sql instance, websites etc

Enjoy :)
