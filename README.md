Here you will find the recap of some of  the work done during my studies at CFA Insta.
These files contains mostly linux environnement files, AND they are not intended to be use in PRODUCTION.

This will setup a small infrastructure (not secured for production), and automatize most of the processes.

If you are a student from Insta, please learn the concepts by yourself and use this repository as a helper.
Do not hesitate to make any branch to make it better !

Enjoy :)
