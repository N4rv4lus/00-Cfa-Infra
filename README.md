Here you will find the recap of some of  the work done during my studies at CFA Insta.
These files contains mostly linux environnement files, AND they are not intended to be use in PRODUCTION.

This will setup a small infrastructure (not secured for production), and automatize most of the processes.

If you are a student from Insta, please learn on yourself and use this repository just to add more knowledges to your labs.
Do not hesitate to make any suggestion / requests to make it better !

Enjoy :)
